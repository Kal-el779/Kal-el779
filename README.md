# 👋 Hey, I’m Kalpesh (aka Kal-el)

**Jack of all trades. CS Engineer living in India.**  
I build things at the intersection of **Machine Learning, AI, and Full-Stack systems** — then break them, fix them, and scale them.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Working On
- Building **ML-powered, real-world systems** (not just notebooks that die after demo day)
- Applied **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**
- Backend-heavy projects with AI brains
- Learning how to take ideas from **“cool concept” → “production-ready”**

---

## 🧠 Tech & Tools I Use
- **Languages:** Python  
- **ML/DL:** PyTorch, TensorFlow  
- **Backend:** FastAPI  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL  
- **Dev Tools:** Git, Docker  
- **Cloud:** In progress

## 🧩 How I Think
- Build first, optimize later  
- Systems > scripts  
- If it doesn’t scale, it doesn’t count  
- Theory is cool — **shipping is cooler**

---

## 🌌 Interests
- Artificial Intelligence & AGI  
- Astronomy & stargazing (yes, I look up when models are training)
- Cutting-edge tech  
- Solving problems most people avoid

---

## 📌 Status
- 🎓 Computer Science & Mathematics student  
- 🛠️ Constantly building  
- 🧠 Always learning  
- 🔥 Playing the long game in AI
